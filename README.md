# ARITHMANCY PUZZLEBOT

Soni's super secret discord both which nobody can know about.

## Current Comamnds
- `>startpuzzle` starts the puzzle
- `>answer <your_answer>` submits a guess to the bot

When the `startpuzzle` command is sent, the team gets 1 riddle to solve. If they can get it within the time limit (+/- 60 seconds), they will have defeated level 1, and move on to level 2, where they will receive two riddles. This goes on for 5 levels. If the team defeats level 5, they will be given the answer to the puzzle.

This bot assumes we have 2 teams competing, and the bot will only take commands from 2 specific channels -- 1 channel per team. Any command outside said channels will receive an error message.
